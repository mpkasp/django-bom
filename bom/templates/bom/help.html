                    <h2>Introduction to IndaBOM Concepts</h2>
                    <p>IndaBOM may be used to create a catalog of parts and to organize parts into assemblies. The parts that comprise a particular assembly is referred to as a Bill of Materials, or
                        BOM.
                        BOMs
                        and
                        parts may be entered directly into IndaBOM or they may be uploaded as comma-separated (CSV) files. Information about an individual part, a collection of parts, or a BOM may be
                        downloaded
                        as CSV files.</p>
                    <p>Parts are grouped by class. A part class represents a category of parts and is used to classify parts, such as resistors, capacitors, or printed circuit board
                        assemblies.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>All of the information about parts, part classes, and BOMs is maintained by IndaBOM in an underlying relational database.</p>
                    <p>The general use model for IndaBOM is to define part classes, then define parts, then define BOMs for the parts that are assemblies of other parts, and then use this information
                        as
                        the
                        authoritative source of parts and assemblies for your projects or products. For example, you might provide a downloaded BOM to a contract manufacturer so that they are able to
                        procure
                        parts and assemble your product.</p>
                    <p>Over time, new part classes and parts may be added and new assembly BOMs may be defined. Similarly, the definitions for existing part classes, parts, and assemblies may be
                        revised
                        or
                        even
                        deleted altogether.</p>
                    <p>IndaBOM is capable of representing many of the key relationships that are required to represent parts and assemblies. Below are some of the key relationships. Note that in the
                        narrative
                        below, a subpart refers to a part that is used to construct another part. A subpart is not a real-world part but rather it represents a relationship between a real-world part
                        and
                        another
                        part that incorporates it (i.e., an assembly). The word assembly is used to indicate a part that contains other parts. Any part can be an assembly. Which ones actually are
                        assemblies
                        are
                        up to you:</p>
                    <p>For each part &hellip;.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;a list of properties and free-form text that specify the part in detail</p>
                    <p>&emsp;a history of revisions that you have made to the part&rsquo;s specification</p>
                    <p>For each part revision ...</p>
                    <p>&emsp;a list of manufacturers who are approved as sources for the part along with each manufacturer&rsquo;s assigned part number, costing information, and other
                        manufacturer-related
                        parameters</p>
                    <p>&emsp;the list of subparts that are required to assemble the particular part</p>
                    <p>For each subpart &hellip;.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;the part that is represented by the subpart</p>
                    <p>&emsp;the list of parts (i.e., assemblies) that use the subpart</p>
                    <p>&emsp;the quantity of the subpart that is needed for a particular assembly</p>
                    <p>&emsp;an optional assembly-specific reference designator (e.g., R1 for a resistor, C1 for a capacitor, and so on)</p>
                    <p>&emsp;an assembly-specific indicator as whether or not the subpart should be loaded into the assembly (referred to as &ldquo;Do No Load&rdquo;)</p>

                    <h3>Organizations</h3>
                    <p>IndaBOM may be used on a shared-host via indabom.com. IndaBOM may also be downloaded and installed on your own server. In either case, you define the organization on whose
                        behalf
                        IndaBOM
                        maintains a database of parts and BOMs. You also define the valid users and their roles. A user may only access the parts and BOMs for their organization and may only perform
                        the
                        IndaBOM
                        operations that are allowed by their role.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section scrollspy">
                    <h3>Users and Roles</h3>
                    <p>An IndaBOM user may be affiliated with only one IndaBOM organization at a time. A user can only view and revise information that is associated with their organization.</p>
                    <p>Within the scope of an organization, an IndaBOM user may have either the role of &ldquo;Viewer&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Admin&rdquo;. A viewer can search for and view data about part
                        classes,
                        parts and BOMs. An admin can additionally add, revise, and delete part class, part and BOM data.</p>
                    <p>The user who initially sets-up IndaBOM for an organization is referred to as the &ldquo;organization&rsquo;s owner&rdquo;. This person may add or remove users to their
                        organization,
                        and
                        they may transfer organizational ownership to another user in the organization. An organization can have only one owner.</p>

                    <h3>Part Numbers</h3>
                    <p>There are two types of part numbering systems you can select when creating your organization. The two types, <b>intelligent</b>, and <b>semi-intelligent</b> (recommended by
                        IndaBOM,
                        sometimes called, "non-intelligent", or "agnostic"), are the most common options used by most manufacturers. Once you make this decision, it can be very hard to change it, so
                        choose
                        wisely!</p>

                <div class="section scrollspy">
                    <h4>Semi-Intelligent Part Numbers</h4>
                    <p>Semi-intelligent IndaBOM part numbers are designed to be simple to assign and simple to subsequently write, type, or speak. This approach makes it a lot easier to maintain part
                        numbers
                        over time while minimizing the possibility of communication or transcription mistakes. There are drawbacks, the arguably most important drawback of semi-intelligent parts is
                        that
                        the
                        part
                        number does not convey much information about a part. </p>
                    <p>If detailed information about a part is needed then IndaBOM may be easily used to look up or search for the part. IndaBOM was originally built using a semi-intelligent, or
                        agnostic
                        part
                        numbering scheme.</p>
                    <p>An IndaBOM part number is comprised of three components:</p>
                    <ul class="browser-default">
                        <li><b>Part Class</b>: A three-digit part class that uniquely represents the class (category) of a particular part as selected from the part classes that you defined for your
                            organization in IndaBOM.&nbsp;
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Item Number</b>: A multi-digit item number, representing the particular part within a part class. You may select the quantity of digits to be for your organization. The
                            minimum
                            is three and the maximum
                            is ten. The default is three.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Variation</b>: A two-character (alpha-numeric) part number variation, enabling multiple configurations or versions of a part to be denoted as an element of a part
                            number.
                            This
                            variation may represent
                            different configurations of a part such as a GN for the green variation versus a BE for the blue variation, or it may denote the version of the part such as 01 vs 02; the
                            decision
                            how
                            to use this field is up to you.&nbsp;
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The overall part number looks like:</p>
                    <p>CCC-NNNNNN-VV</p>
                    <p>where the quantity of number item digits N depends on your organization&rsquo;s configuration (six in this example).</p>
                    <p>IndaBOM ensures that every part number is unique relative to an organization&rsquo;s catalog of parts. In other words, the tuple {CCC, NNNNNN, VV} is defined as unique in
                        IndaBOM&rsquo;s
                        underlying database.</p>
                    <p>The actual assignment of part numbers may be done explicitly or automatically. When you create a part, or when you uploaded a list of parts, you may specify the part numbers
                        that
                        you
                        would
                        like IndaBOM to use. As long as a part number you specify is unique then it will be accepted by IndaBOM.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, you can just specify a part&rsquo;s part class and leave it to IndaBOM to assign an item number. The item number created by IndaBOM will be one greater-than the
                        largest
                        item
                        number that has <em>ever</em> been assigned to the new part&rsquo;s part class. The variation will be set to &ldquo;00&rdquo;.</p>
                    <p>No matter how a part number was created, you can of course subsequently change a part's part class or variation to whatever you would like.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section scrollspy">
                    <h5>A note on Part Classes</h5>
                    <p>Part classes are not built into IndaBOM. Instead, one of the first things you need to do when you set-up your IndaBOM environment is to define part classes. A part class is
                        represented
                        by a
                        unique number and a unique name. It may also optionally include a comment or description.</p>
                    <p>You can define part classes by uploading a CSV file in which one column contains a name for the part class, and another column contains the three-digit code that you have
                        assigned.
                        Alternatively, you manually may define a part class using a form.</p>
                    <p>You may also use <a href="{% static 'bom/doc/sample_part_classes.csv' %}">this sample CSV file</a>.</p>
                    <p>Over time you may add additional part classes, and you can edit or delete existing part classes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section scrollspy">
                    <h4>Intelligent Part Numbers</h4>
                    <p>Intelligent part numbering on IndaBOM allows the user to assign any part number to a part. The part number contains descriptive details embedded within that provides noteworthy
                        information
                        about the part. For example, a capacitor may be named C0402X5R33PF to indicate that it is a capacitor of size "0402", using a X5R dialectric, and is 33pF.</p>
                    <p>Though it may seem beneficial at first to use an intelligent part numbering schemes due to readability, the drawbacks include limited automation when creating parts, potential
                        need
                        for
                        training, challenges when a new part is developed that may not fit the existing numbering scheme, and reduced ability to use automation.</p>
                    <p>Intelligent part numbering may be more beneficial to those that want to keep existing habits and processes in place, otherwise we recommend using the Semi-intelligent
                        system.</p>
                    <p>There are many great articles online about the pros and cons of Intelligent part numbering systems - we recommend you to do your research before deciding!</p>

                    <h3>Part Specifications &amp; Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>IndaBOM is designed to handle a wide-range of parts. To enable you to adequately specify your parts, you may use a mix of pre-defined part properties in conjunction with
                        free-form
                        text
                        to
                        fully specify a part. A part property may be just a value, or it may be a value and an associated unit of measure.</p>
                    <p>The list of available properties is comprehensive but not exhaustive. The free-form text provides a means for conveying information not covered by the properties.</p>
                    <p>When information about a part is displayed a synopsis is often generated and displayed. A part&rsquo;s synopsis is a synthesis of the property values and associated units of
                        measure,
                        along
                        with free-form text, that were used to specify the part.</p>
                    <p>The synopsis also plays a role when you search for parts. Anything contained in a part&rsquo;s synopsis may be subsequently searched for.</p>

                    <h3>Part Revisions</h3>
                    <p>As you edit, update or otherwise revise a part&rsquo;s specification, you can use IndaBOM to keep track of your specification revisions. Independent of how you choose to use the
                        part
                        number
                        part variation field, a revision is a snapshot of your part in terms of the specification information captured and stored in IndaBOM.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>A newly created part is assigned a revision of 1. You may edit a part without changing its revision, or you may create a new revision with is initialized with data from the
                        latest
                        revision.
                        Note that you cannot explicitly set the revision number. Instead, IndaBOM manages the assignment of revision numbers, for example, it will increment a part&rsquo;s current
                        revision
                        number
                        when you instruct IndaBOM to create a new revision.</p>
                    <p>In addition, at various times IndaBOM will automatically manage part revisions for you. For example, if you change a part&rsquo;s part class and the part number item and number
                        variation
                        would conflict with a part that already exists in the target class, then IndaBOM will create a new revision of the part. The revision number will be set to one greater than the
                        largest
                        revision for the otherwise conflicting part.</p>

                    <h3>Part Release Management</h3>
                    <p>IndaBOM enables you to control whether or not a part&rsquo;s specification is still a work-in-progress, or whether it has been released for use by your team. A part is tagged in
                        IndaBOM
                        as
                        &ldquo;Working&rdquo; if it is a work-in-progress, in which case you may continue to edit the part&rsquo;s specification or create new revisions. When you are ready, you can
                        change
                        a
                        part&rsquo;s
                        status so that it is tagged as &ldquo;Released&rdquo;. You will not be able to edit the specification or create new revisions of the specification for a &ldquo;Released&rdquo;
                        part.
                        However, you can revert a &ldquo;Released&rdquo; part back to &ldquo;Working&rdquo;, edit the specification or create additional revisions, and then re-tag the part as &ldquo;Released&rdquo;.</p>

                    <h3>Case Sensitivity</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the IndaBOM application you will need to enter names for part classes, organizations, and manufacturers. These names you enter are stored in with case preserved, but
                        for
                        comparison purposes the names are treated as case insensitive. In fact, for comparison purposes, any text that you enter is treated as case insensitive.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>For example, the part class names &ldquo;capacitor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Capacitor&rdquo; are treated by IndaBOM as the same thing when it comes to validating part class names. You
                        can
                        edit
                        the
                        part class &ldquo;Capacitor&rdquo; so that its new name is &ldquo;capacitor&rdquo;, but if you try to create another part class so that its name is also &ldquo;capacitor&rdquo;,
                        or
                        &ldquo;Capacitor&rdquo;,
                        or &ldquo;CaPaCiTor&rdquo;, or any other combination of upper and lower case, as long as it spells &ldquo;capacitor&rdquo; then the new part class name will be flagged as an
                        error
                        and

                    <p>Once you have logged into IndaBOM you will be brought to the application&rsquo;s Home page. From this you may select a part class in order to view all of the parts in the class,
                        or
                        you
                        can

                    <p>The &ldquo;Upload&rdquo; menu at the top of the page enables you to upload CSV&rsquo;s files for parts, BOMs, or part classes. Other buttons at the top of the page enable you to

                    <p>In addition, pop-up icon buttons at the bottom right of the Home page enable you to explicitly create a part using a form or to upload parts from a CSV file.</p>

                    <h3>Search Results Page</h3>
                    <p>The Search Results page is a lot like the Home page except that it lists the part or parts that satisfy your search criteria or part class selection. The information displayed
                        about
                        each
                        part includes the part number, a synopsis, and a drop-drop down menu that gives you various choices about how you can download information about the part to a CSV file.</p>
                    <p>The synopsis presents information about the part as culled from the property values and free-text information that have been specified.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>If you like, you can use the search function on the Search Results page to search for parts within the part class that you previously selected (if, in fact, you had done so).
                        You
                        may
                        also
                        select a different part class to view, obviating the need to return to the Home page.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, from the Search Results page you can also download to a CSV file the information presented about all of the parts listed in the search results list.</p>
                    <p>And, from this page, you can select any part for viewing in detail by clicking on its part number.</p>
                    <p>Finally, if you have the role of Admin, then can show or hide controls that allow you to select one or more parts to delete from IndaBOM. You should do this carefully because
                        the
                        deleting
                        of a part cannot be undone. You will have to re-enter the information about a part you did not really want to delete.</p>

                <div class="section scrollspy">
                    <h3>Searching</h3>
                    <p>You can use free-form searching to find parts based upon a part&rsquo;s part number, synopsis, primary manufacturer&rsquo;s name or primary manufacturer&rsquo;s part number
                        (MPN).
                        Terms
                        that represents these elements may be mixed and matched in your search expression.</p>
                    <p>If you enter a part number as a search term then to be recognized as a part number, it must at least include the part class number and the item number. It may optionally include
                        the
                        number
                        item variation.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>For example, both 102-00033-04 and 102-000033 are valid part number search terms. This example assumes that your organization uses 5 digits for its item
                        number.</p>
                    <p>When entering a free-form search expression, the special characters that are used by IndaBOM to display units of measure need to be represented as standard text characters in
                        your
                        search
                        term:</p>
                    <ul class="browser-default">
                        <li>&Omega; is represented as Ohms or ohms</li>
                        <li>&mu; is represented as U or u</li>
                        <li>&deg;C is represented as C or c</li>
                        <li>&deg;F is represented as F or f</li>
                        <li>&Aring; is represented A or a</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can narrow your search to a specific class of parts by first selecting a part class. For example, to search for all capacitors whose capacitance is
                        10&mu;F, you would first select the capacitor part class, then enter 10uF as the search term.</p>
                    <p>Matches will be made against partial words as well, for example yel will match all parts that contain the word &ldquo;yellow&rdquo;or &ldquo;Yellow&rdquo;
                        or &ldquo;yell&rdquo; and so-on.</p>
                    <p>If your search expression is composed of multiple terms, then each search term is OR&rsquo;ed, meaning that the search results will list all of the parts that match at least one
                        of
                        the
                        terms of your search expression.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>For example, if your search term is 270Ohms 5% 0805 then your search will list all parts that contain &ldquo;270&Omega;&rdquo; or the &ldquo;5%&rdquo; or &ldquo;0805&rdquo;.
                    </p>
                    <p>White space, comprised of any number of spaces or tabs, separates your search terms. If you have a term that is composed of multiple words and you want these words to be treated
                        as
                        a
                        single
                        term then they should be put in quotes, for example &ldquo;Big Company Inc.&rdquo; will be treated as single term whereas Big Company Inc. will be treated
                        as three separate terms.</p>
                    <p>Given how white space is interpreted, you should not have whitespace between a value and the associated units of measure. In other words, want to search for parts that contain
                        &ldquo;10V&rdquo;,
                        then your search term should be 10V or &ldquo;10V&rdquo; as opposed to 10 V. If you type 10 V then the
                        10 and the V will be treated as separate search terms and the search will match all parts that contain &ldquo;10&rdquo; and &ldquo;V&rdquo;, which is
                        probably not what you want!</p>
                    <p>Finally, note that after you perform a search that the search expression you used continues to be displayed. This servers as a reminder for what you searched for, and it enables
                        you
                        to
                        easily edit the search expression to make minor adjustments. If you want to start a completely new search then just type over your previous search or push the &ldquo;Clear&rdquo;
                        button.</p>

                    <p>Ratings &ndash; properties representing electrical and temperature limits for a part&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Miscellaneous &ndash; properties generally useful for describing an electronic part, such as memory capacity</p>
                    <p>Appearance &ndash; properties that describe a part&rsquo;s color, finish and material&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Dimensions &ndash; properties that describe the size and weight of a part</p>
                    <p>Other &ndash; free-form text describing properties not included in any of the above</p>
                    <p>The type of value you can enter for a particular property is generally constrained. In some cases, the value must be a number. In other cases, the value must be selected from a
                        drop
                        down
                        list.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Most properties also have an associated unit of measure. If a property has a value and units of measure, then you must specify both. For each property that has an associated
                        units
                        of
                        measure, a list a relevant built-in units appears in a drop down list.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>All property-related drop down lists include the choice &ldquo;Other&rdquo;. You can use the free-form text fields to explain how users should interpret &ldquo;Other&rdquo;.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, you can use free-form text fields to provide additional information, such as special storage or handling instructions, or to describe properties not presented in
                        the
                        form.</p>
                    <p>When you are done, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select &ldquo;save&rdquo;.</p>

                    <h3>Uploading Parts</h3>
                    <p>If you have the role of Admin, then you may upload the specification for one or more parts from a comma-separated-value (CSV) file. A pop-up icon button at the bottom right of
                        the
                        Home
                        page
                        and search results page, as well as several other pages, also enable you to upload a CSV file for parts. Uploading can also be initiated using the &ldquo;Upload&rdquo; menu
                        that
                        appears at
                        the top of the Home page and Search Results pages.</p>
                    <p>When you upload parts from a CSV file you can assign IndaBOM part numbers in the file or you can allow IndaBOM to automatically assign part numbers. If you specify a part number
                        that is
                        already in use then the conflicting part will not be uploaded. Similarly, other errors may prevent a part from being uploaded, for example, an improperly formatted IndaBOM part
                        number
                        or
                        the use of an unknown IndaBOM part class. The uploading will continue with the next valid part in the file.</p>

                        <li>Specifications: Under the Manufacturer and sourcing tab, after the page loads, we ping Mouser and update BOM costs. This may take a few seconds, and you will know it's done
                            when a
                            Mouser "M" icon shows up.

                    <p>To make sure the integration works, you need to enable Mouser Sourcing for the part class of interest (e.g. if you have a Capacitor part class, you need to enable mouser
                        sourcing
                        for
                        this part class). This setting is found in Settings > IndaBOM under part classes. From here, a part is searched for in Mouser by part number and manfuacturer, or just part
                        number
                        if

                    <p>The Bill Of Materials display orders the listing of parts based upon the optional reference designator assigned to the part. For example, using common electrical engineering
                        conventions,
                        capacitors might have a reference designator that begins with the letter &lsquo;C&rsquo; followed by a number, such as C10, C13, C26 and so on. A resistor might have a
                        reference
                        designator
                        that begins with the letter &lsquo;R&rdquo; followed by a number, such as R1, R13, R15. In the Bill Of Materials listing, these parts would be presented in the order: C10, C13,
                        C26,
                        R1,
                        R13, R15.</p>
                    <p>A reference designator may be comprised of any printable character. It cannot, however, include any of the delimiters listed below.</p>
                    <p>If a part does not have a reference then its part number is used to determine its order in the listing.</p>
                    <p>Whether editing a BOM or uploading a BOM, a warning will be issued when the same reference designator is associated with multiple parts in a Bill of Materials. Sometimes it is
                        desirable
                        to
                        use the same reference designator for multiple parts, which is why this situation is only a warning. The warning is displayed at the top of the page.</p>
                    <p>Further, when a part is added to a BOM or an existing BOM part is edited, and a reference designator is specified, then the number of designators must match the part quantity
                        specified.
                        Multiple reference designators may be separated by white space, commas, semi-colons, colons, or tabs, such as &ldquo;R1, R2, R3&rdquo; or &ldquo;R1 R2 R3&rdquo; or &ldquo;R1;
                        R2,
                        R3&rdquo;.
                        If the number of reference designators does not match the part quantity then an error is presented and the part is not added to the BOM.</p>

                    <h3>Editing a BOM</h3>
                    <p>From the Bill Of Materials page it is possible to edit a BOM. The &ldquo;Manage&rdquo; menu on the right side of the page includes the choice &ldquo;Edit BOM&rdquo;. When
                        selected,
                        a
                        form
                        appears that enables adding a part to the current BOM. The part of interest is identified by its part number. The quantity of parts, one or more reference designators, and the
                        ability
                        to
                        indicate &ldquo;do not load&rdquo; are parameters that may be set when adding a part. Only parts that are already in your IndaBOM database may be added to a BOM.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section scrollspy">
                    <h3>Editing a Subpart</h3>
                    <p>When a BOM is being edited, it is also possible to edit the information about an existing subpart or remove a subpart altogether. At the end of each subpart row is a drop down
                        menu
                        that
                        allows you to edit or delete the subpart. If you chose to edit the subpart you can change which part revision it is tied to, you can change its reference designator(s), you can
                        change
                        the
                        quantity of the subpart, and you can set or unset the subpart&rsquo;s Do Not Load flag.</p>
                    <p>If you chose to delete the part then it will be removed from the BOM you are editing. This does not affect any other BOM, and it does not affect the part that the subpart is
                        tied
                        to. In
                        addition, if the subpart appears more than once in the BOM, deleting a subpart row only removes the information contained on that row.</p>

                <div class="section scrollspy">
                    <h3>Uploading a BOM</h3>
                    <p>A BOM may be uploaded from a comma-separated file. This can be done from the bottom of the Bill of Materials page when a particular BOM is being edited. It can also be done
                        using the &ldquo;Upload&rdquo; menu that appears on the Home page and search results pages.</p>
                    <p>When you upload BOM subparts from a file, errors may prevent a subpart from being uploaded, for example, an improperly formatted part number.
                        The uploading may continue with the next valid subpart in the file, if it can.</p>
                    <p>Here is <a href="{% static 'bom/doc/test_bom_5_intelligent.csv' %}">a sample CSV file for uploading intelligent parts</a> and here is <a
