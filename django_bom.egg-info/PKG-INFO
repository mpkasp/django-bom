# BOM
![](https://github.com/mpkasp/django-bom/workflows/Django%20CI/badge.svg)

BOM is a simple Django app to manage a bill of materials. It supports multiple part numbering schemes, tracking component sourcing information, estimates costs, and contains smart integrations with Mouser to pull in the latest component pricing and Google Drive for part file management. BOM is written in Python 3 and Django 3.

[See a live example](https://www.indabom.com).

BOM can be added to an existing (or new) Django project, or stand alone on its own, which can be more convenient if you're interested in tweaking the tool. 

If you already have a django project, you can skip to [Add Django Bom To Your App](#add-django-bom-to-your-app), otherwise [Start From Scratch: Add to new Django project](#start-from-scratch-add-to-a-new-django-project) to add it to a new django project, or [Start From Scratch: Use as standalone Django project](#start-from-scratch-use-as-a-standalone-django-project).

## Start From Scratch: Add to a new Django project
1. To start from scratch we recommend setting up a virtual environment
```
virtualenv -p python3 mysite
cd mysite
source bin/activate
```

2. From here install django, and set up your project.
```
pip install django
django-admin startproject mysite
cd mysite
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser # make a user for your development environment
```

3. Continue on to [Add Django Bom To Your App](#add-django-bom-to-your-app).

## Add Django Bom To Your App
django-bom is a [reusable django application](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/reusable-apps/). If you don't already have a django project, you can follow some quick steps below to get up and running, or read about creating your first django app [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/). Note that django-bom currently supports python 2.7.

```
pip install django-bom
```

1. Add "bom" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'bom',
    'social_django', # to enable google drive sync in bom
    'djmoney', # for currency
    'djmoney.contrib.exchange', # for currency
    'materializecssform',
]
```

2. Update your URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

```
path('bom/', include('bom.urls')),
```

And don't forget to import include:

```
from django.conf.urls import include
```

3. Update your settings.py to add the bom context processor `'bom.context_processors.bom_config',` to your TEMPLATES variable, and create a new empty dictionary BOM_CONFIG.

```
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                ...
                'bom.context_processors.bom_config',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

and

```
BOM_CONFIG = {}
```

4. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the bom models.

5. Start the development server `python manage.py runserver` and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to manage the bom (you'll need the Admin app enabled).

6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/bom/ to begin.

   
## Start From Scratch: Use as a standalone Django project
1. To start from scratch we recommend setting up a virtual environment
```
virtualenv -p python3 mysite
cd mysite
source bin/activate
```

2. From here install django, and set up your project.
```
git clone https://github.com/mpkasp/django-bom.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
cp bom/local_settings.py.example bom/local_settings.py
python manage.py runserver
```

## Customize Base Template
The base template can be customized to your pleasing. Just add the following configuration to your settings.py:

```
BOM_CONFIG = {
    'base_template': 'base.html',
}
```

where `base.html` is your base template.

## Integrations
### Mouser Integration
For part matching, make sure to add your Mouser api key. You can get your key [here](https://www.mouser.com/MyMouser/MouserSearchApplication.aspx).

### Google Drive Integration
Make sure to add the following to your settings.py:
```
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'social_core.backends.google.GoogleOpenId',
    'social_core.backends.google.GoogleOAuth2',
    'social_core.backends.google.GoogleOAuth',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)

SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SCOPE = ['email', 'profile', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login']
SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_AUTH_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS = {
    'access_type': 'offline',
    'approval_prompt': 'auto'
}
``` 
And if you're using https on production add:
```
SOCIAL_AUTH_REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS = not DEBUG
```

### FIXER
Fixer.io is used to handle exchange rate calculations. This is helpful if you may be purchasing parts from another currency (especially via Mouser) and you still need to estimate your part costs.

To set this up you just need to add your API key to local_settings.py as shown in the example.

To update rates, migrate and run `python manage.py update_rates`. Some day we will need to add a (celerybeat?) task to update rates on a schedule. Explained more [here](https://github.com/django-money/django-money#working-with-exchange-rates).

## Installation Pitfalls

### Windows
#### Sqlite
You may get an error during your `pip install -r requirements.txt` related to sqlite. This may be fixed by installing Visual C++ for python...

#### Cryptography
Sometimes you'll have issues installing cryptography, if this is the case you may just need to set up some environment variables. This [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46288737/error-while-installing-sqlite-using-pip-on-python-2-7-13) may help.
